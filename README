mrben : a blog
==============

This is the code for my blog and was created as an exercise in learning Django and integrating with a few popular APIs.

Consequently there are plenty of things I would do differently.

I'm going to try and do that ... eventually.

This project uses buildout.

```
python bootstrap.py
./bin/buildout
./bin/django syncdb
./bin/django migrate
./bin/django runserver
```

You will need to define your settings in settings.py or settings_local.py.
