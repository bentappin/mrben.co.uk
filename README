mrben : a blog
==============

This is the code for my blog and was created as an exercise in learning Django and integrating with a few popular APIs.

Consequently there are plenty of things I would do differently!

I'm going to try and do that over the coming months.

You will need to define the following values in your settings file:
TWITTER_USER = ''
TWITTER_TIMEOUT = 3600
LASTFM_KEY = ''
LASTFM_SECRET = ''
LASTFM_USER = ''
LASTFM_PWDHASH = ''
LASTFM_TIMEOUT = 3600
FLICKR_KEY = ''
FLICKR_SECRET = ''
FLICKR_ID = ''
FLICKR_TIMEOUT = 3600
